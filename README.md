# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Description 

In this challenge, I have the task of create JavaScript code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I've been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses. with these records, I have to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * For this I will track what the total change in profits are from month to month (without including the first month) and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


 I will try to put in practice some concepts I've learned so far, creating variables with primitive data types, using comparison operators, conditional statements and iterations and printing them on the console.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://github.com/mchinojo/4Console-Finances


## Installation

Clone the project and open it using your favourite browser (I recommend using Chrome).


## Usage 

My code should print the analysis to the console, so please open Chrome DevTools and select the "Console" tab.

My resulting analysis should have these numbers, please remember that I'm not including the first month on the average change.
